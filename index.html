        <p>Each and every expanse of Bangladesh abounds in greenery, but none can compare with Sylhet. From spinning hills covered in lush green tea gardens and gleaming paddy fields to olive marshlands and reserved forests, Sylhet seems to have been blessed with every possible shade of green one can imagine.

            Visit Sylhet is a platform to inspire people to explore greater Sylhet. Our purpose is to deliver growth for Sylhet by attracting visitors and building Sylhet reputation as a true destination.

        <p>Saint Martin (French: Saint-Martin; Dutch: Sint Maarten) is an island in the northeast Caribbean Sea, approximately 300 km (190 mi) east of Puerto Rico. The 87 square kilometres (34 sq mi) island is divided roughly 60:40 between the French Republic (53 square kilometres (20 sq mi))[1] and the Kingdom of the Netherlands (34 square kilometres (13 sq mi)),[2] but the Dutch part is more populated than the French part. The division dates to 1648. The northern French part comprises the Collectivity of Saint Martin and is an overseas collectivity of the French Republic. As part of France, the French part of the island is also part of the European Union.[6] The southern Dutch part comprises Sint Maarten and is one of four constituent countries that form the Kingdom of the Netherlands.</p>
